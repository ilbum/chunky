# Chunky

**Chunky** is an open-source tool that efficiently processes large documents by breaking them into optimized chunks and embedding them for more accurate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Chunky is designed to work with large documents, whether it's a research paper, government policy, or a novel, chunky ensures your **document chunks are structured and embedded for maximum relevance and accuracy**.

## Features

Goal: RAG Optimization

🛠️ Automatic Chunking – Splits large documents into semantically meaningful chunks
🕵️ Customizable Chunking Strategies – Choose from fixed-size, semantic, or overlap-based chunking
🕵️ Embeddings Integration – Supports OpenAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, and other embedding models
🕵️ Efficient Storage & Retrieval – Works seamlessly with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB, Weaviate, FAISS)
🕵️ Multiple File Support – Ingests PDFs, Word docs, Markdown, and plain text

🛠️ — in progress
🕵️ — investigating
